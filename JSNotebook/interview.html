    <p><em>What I learned today is how to ask the user of my website, which is you, questions, allowing you to respond with specific types of responses. If I code "readInt", this will only allow you to type an integer. If I code "readLine", you will be able to put anything you'd like in your response, and the computer would take it. If I code "readBoolean", then you would be able to answer the question with many different variations of true or false!</em></p>
